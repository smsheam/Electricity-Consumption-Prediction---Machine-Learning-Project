# Thesis Title: 
Electricity Consumption Prediction during Ship Construction - A Machine Learning Approach

# Description: 
This repository contains the machine learning code developed for my undergraduate thesis.Here, a multivariate linear regression model to predict electricity consumption during ship construction was applied. It will help a shipbuilder to predict the electricity cost and optimize the manufacturing cost.

  Dataset covering 21 ships with columns: `length`, `breadth`, `depth`, `ship_type`, `filler_metal`, and `electricity_consumption`.


# Overview
**Objective:** 
This study tries to develop a machine learning model for predicting electricity consumption during ship construction, enables to calculate approximate manufacturing costs for specific ship types at preliminary design phase according to owner's requirements and to establish comprehensive relationships between electricity consumption and different types of parameters

**Machine Learning Model:** 
Multivariate Linear Regression is used to predict welding filler metal requirements and electricity usage based on ship dimensions and type.

**Visualization:** 
Includes scatter plots (actual vs. predicted), identity line plots, and a correlation heatmap.
